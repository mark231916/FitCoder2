## Description:
FitCoders is a Social Calorie Tracking Platform. Users can log into their profiles, Enter their fitness goals and where they are currently, and the app will suggest them their calorie intake and outake. Aditionally, the app will also allow the user to generate graphs of their previous calorie intakes and also allow the user to add their meals that they ate. One way to add food in the tracker would be using the built-in Barcorcode scanner that will scan the food barcode and automatically log the calories in the user's profile!
